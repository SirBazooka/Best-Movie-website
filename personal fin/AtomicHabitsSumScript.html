    <p>Do you ever feel like you're just floating through  

        life...but not actually getting closer 
        to the person that you want to be.
         
        
        It usually happens around New Years, you imagine 
        all the bad habits you re going to break free  
        
        from, and all the good habits you will begin.
        This time it will be different you say to  
        
        yourself. This time I AM going to 
        do the things that I say I will.
         
        
        Only to end up back where you began shortly 
        after and no closer to what you had envisaged.
         
        
        So the question is, how do you become the person 
        you dream of becoming? How do you break free  
        
        from bad habits and make the habits 
        you desire easier and automatic?
         
        
        Atomic Habits by James Clear 
        answers all these questions.
         
        
        We are going to be doing a detailed visual summary 
        of this book, and dive deep into topics like
         
        
        Habit loops
        Dopamine spikes 
         
        
        Priming your environment
        Plus heaps more
         
        
        And make sure to stick around until the 
        end of the video where we tie everything  
        
        together from the video and I go step by step 
        through how I've personally been using this  
        
        book with my own habits and how you can 
        start applying it to your own habits.
         
        
        I hope this summary inspires you to go out and 
        grab a copy of the book for yourself because this  
        
        book deserves a space on everyone s bookshelf!
        Let s jump into it
         
        
        Imagine a plane taking off and 
        travelling from New York to Los Angeles.  
        
        Just before takeoff you adjust the 
        plane just slightly by 3 degrees  
        
        or around 80 inches. If you kept flying 
        in a straight line...You would end up  
        
        closer to Tijuana in Mexico than in your 
        intended destination of Los Angeles.
         
        
        The same goes for our habits. Tiny changes in our 
        habits can change the trajectory of our lives in  
        
        ways that we can t even notice until many years 
        into the future looking back. In both good ways  
        
        and bad. You are your habits.
        The Power of Atomic Habits
         
        
        A slight change in your daily habits can guide 
        your life to a very different destination .
         
        
        Massive action Vs 1% improvements
        Far too often, we convince ourselves that  
        
        massive success is only possible through massive 
        action in any goal we are pursuing. We expect  
        
        ourselves to make some quantum leap or momentous 
        improvement that will gain others attention.
         
        
        However it is the tiny improvements, 
        that aren t even noticeable at first,  
        
        that create incredible change. 
         
         
        Let s look deeper into the Math
         
        
        1% better every day for a year will 
        compound to nearly 38 times better.
         
        
        1% worse every day for over a year 
        will bring you close to zero!
         
        
        Your habits can compound against you in the form 
        of things like stress or negative self-talk.
         
        
        Or they can compound for you in 
        the form of things like knowledge,  
        
        productivity, skills and relationships.
         
        
        Success is the product of 
        daily habits not once-in 
         
        
        a lifetime transformations 
        The Truth About progress
         
        
        When you start any endeavor in your life, here is 
        what we think should happen. Linear progress.
         
        
        Here is what actually happens. Notice 
        this section here. In the beginning,  
        
        small changes in our progress 
        are not even noticeable.
         
        
        James Clear refers to this part of the 
        graph as the valley of disappointment  
        
        You ve done so much! Put in so much 
        effort and you can barely see any results!  
        
        This is where most people fail and 
        slip back into their old routines.
         
        
        The most powerful outcomes of any compounding 
        process are delayed so Patience is required.
         
        
        Goals Vs Systems.
        FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD 
         
        
        A goal is the result you want 
        to accomplish. Systems deal  
        
        with the processes that lead to results.
        The conventional wisdom suggests that the best  
        
        way to achieve anything we want in life-getting 
        into better shape, building a successful business,  
        
        spending more time with family is 
        to set specific, realistic goals.
         
        
        But if you completely ignored your 
        goals and focused only on your system,  
        
        would you still succeed?
        The Author argues that you would.
         
        
        Here are some problems with only having goals.
        Successful and unsuccessful people share the  
        
        same goals, so therefore the goal cannot be 
        what differentiates winners from losers. 
         
        
        Achieving a goal only changes 
        your life for a moment in time. 
         
        
        Goals can create an either-or conflict. 
        Either you achieve the goal and succeed,  
        
        or you don t and you are a failure. Even if you 
        were making progress in the right direction 
         
        
        When you achieve a goal, what do you do after? 
        If your goal was running the local marathon,  
        
        chances are after completing it, your 
        motivation will quickly fade and you will  
        
        just slip back into your old routines.
        Goals are good for setting a direction,  
        
        but systems are best for making progress 
        A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS
         
        
        The problem with changing your habits is 
        not you. The reason why you repeat the  
        
        same bad habit for so long isn't because 
        you don't want to change, but because you  
        
        have the wrong system for change.
        Atomic habits are small routines and  
        
        behaviors that accumulate to produce 
        incremental positive outcomes over time.  
        
        Big breakthroughs tend to get more attention than 
        small improvements. But what really matters are  
        
        the little daily decisions and actions we take.
        Just as atoms are the building blocks of  
        
        molecules, atomic habits are the building 
        blocks of remarkable results .
         
        
        There are 3 layers to behavior change.
        The first layer is changing outcomes. The result.  
        
        Losing that weight, writing that book, winning 
        the season. The outcomes are what you get
         
        
        The Second layer is changing your process. 
        What you do. The new workout routine,  
        
        developing a daily reading habit.
        And the third layer is changing your  
        
        identity. What you believe. Your worldviews 
        and how you think about yourself and others.
         
        
        Most people focus on the outcomes but 
        the best way to change your habits  
        
        is by focusing on the person you want to 
        become instead of the results you want.
         
        
        The goal isn t to learn an instrument, 
        it is to become a musician.
         
        
        The goal isn t to run a marathon, 
        it is to become a runner.
         
        
        When something you want in your life 
        becomes part of your identity that is when  
        
        your behaviors will naturally change.
        When you tell yourself and others I m a  
        
        runner . You want to live up to that identity.
        Remind yourself
         
        
        Every Time you do a workout, you are an athlete. 
        Every time you write a line of code,  
        
        you are a coder. 
        Each time you instruct your team,  
        
        you are a leader.
        The Habit Loop
         
         
        
        A habit is when something has been repeated 
        enough times that it becomes automatic.  
        
        Ultimately we want our habits to solve problems 
        in our lives with the least amount of effort.
         
        
        A habit is formed and reinforced by 
        means of a continuous feedback loop:  
        
        Cue + Craving + Response + Reward. The key to 
        creating habits that stick is to create feedback  
        
        loops that are continuously being improved.
        Cue. Phone buzz. Craving. Want to know who  
        
        messaged. Response. Pick up phone. Reward. 
        Solve the problem of who messaged.
         
        
        Cue. Mind goes blank at work. Craving. 
        Want to alleviate the frustration.  
        
        Response. Check social media. Reward. 
        Satisfied the need to feel less frustrated
         
        
        Over time, rewards become associated with cues.
        So, in this example, checking social media becomes  
        
        tied to your mind going blank at work.
        And then checking Facebook may be the cue  
        
        to check Instagram, which becomes 
        the cue to check YouTube.
         
        
        And before you know it, your mind going blank 
        cue has led to 20 minutes of wasted time.
         
        
        And you more you repeat these habit loops, the 
        stronger and more automatic they become.
         
        
        Cues can really be anything. A smell, a 
        sound a sight, a person, a location etc.
         
        
        Try to think of any cues in your daily life that 
        are initiating your good or bad habit loops.
         
        
        So how can we influence the 
        habit loop to work for us?
         
        
        This book shows us the 4 laws that 
        will guide us to do just that.
         
        
        Law 1 Make it obvious
        Most of your current habits are so automatic that  
        
        you don t even realize them. You must first become 
        aware of your habits before you can change them.  
        
        You can achieve that with your Habit Scorecard.
        Write down all your daily behaviors on a habits  
        
        scorecard, from the moment you wake 
        up until the moment you go to bed.
         
        
        Your scorecard may look something like this.
        Based on whether it helps you become the person  
        
        you aspire to be, categorize each habit as 
        positive (+), negative (-), or neutral (=).
         
        
        At this stage we aren t trying to 
        change anything, just observe what  
        
        is actually going on in our daily lives.
        Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will  
        
        direct your life and you will call it fate. 
        Carl Yung
         
        
        Vagueness is a real problem when it comes to habit 
        formation, and studies have shown that quite often  
        
        the reason people fail to stick to a habit is not 
        because of a lack of motivation, but because of a  
        
        lack of clarity. One day, I will get into shape is 
        easy to say to yourself but too vague to get any  
        
        momentum. What you need is a time and a place.
        The most common cues time and location will  
        
        help you achieve your goals. Clearly state your 
        intention to act using the following formula:
         
        
        I will behavior at time in this location.
        Here is a bad example,
         
        
        I will read more this month 
        Here is a good example
         
        
        I will read a book for 15 minutes 
        daily at 6am in the spare bedroom .
         
        
        Another good way to get a habit 
        started is by Habit stacking.
          
         
        
        To stack habits, tie a 
        desired habit to an existing  
        
        habit according to the following formula:
        After [current habit], I will [new habit] .
         
        
        For example,
        After I brush my teeth,  
        
        I will stretch for 5 minutes .
         
          
        You can stack habits together, for example after  
        
        you finish brushing your teeth, you will meditate 
        for 10 minutes, then plan the rest of your day,  
        
        before checking social media.
        A chain of habits is more likely to be sustained  
        
        if you practice this consistently.
         
          
        Choosing the correct trigger is essential.  
        
        YOU NEED A TRIGGER CUE
        Your trigger should be;
         
        
        Something that you do automatically without 
        fail during your day, such as waking up, turning  
        
        off your alarm or brushing your teeth.
         
        James Clear tells us in the book that Motivation  
        
        is highly overrated. You can better shape 
        your behavior by designing your environment. 
         
        
        We are more influenced by our environment 
        than our willpower or motivation. 
         
        
        It s hard to stick to positive 
        habits in a negative environment.
         
        
        Environment is the invisible hand 
        that shapes human behavior.  
          
         
        
        Creating a habit requires you to redesign 
        the space around you (home/work) to 
         
        
        1 - make it easier to see the 
        cues for the desired habits and 
         
        
        2 - avert bad habits by making them invisible.
        If you want to drink more water, make the cues  
        
        visible and obvious. Place water bottles around 
        the house in places you are likely to see them.  
        
        Want to read more? Place the 
        book somewhere you will see it.  
        
        If you want to get better on the guitar, 
        don t leave it out of sight in a closet. 
         
        
        CONTEXT IS THE CUE
        Objects in the environment  
        
        do not determine our behavior; rather, it is our 
        relationship to them that does. Stop seeing your  
        
        environment as a place simply filled with objects. 
        Imagine it as a place filled with relationships.
         
        
        The couch in the living room is the place 
        where one person reads an hour a night.  
        
        For another, the couch is where they watch 
        Netflix and eat pizza and relax after work.  
        
        If your relationship with the couch is a place 
        to relax, then trying to get a work related task  
        
        done in that environment may be difficult.
        Try to make separate zones in your house for  
        
        different activities. The author likes 
        to use the mantra One space, One use 
         
        
        If you are trying to eliminate a bad habit, You 
        can only rely on self-control in the short-term.  
        
        Cutting off bad habits at the source is 
        a more reliable solution and one of the  
        
        most practical ways to eliminate a 
        bad habit is to make it invisible.  
        
        Eliminate it from your environment.
        For example
         
        
        Put your phone in another room for a few 
        hours if you have trouble getting work done. 
         
        
        Put junk food out of sight or remove it from 
        your house if you are trying to lose weight.
         
        
        Law 2
        Making it Attractive
         
        
        When we expect to be rewarded, we take 
        action. The more rewarding an action is,  
        
        the more likely we are to repeat 
        it until it becomes a habit.  
        
        Hence, the first step to forming good 
        habits is to make them more attractive.
